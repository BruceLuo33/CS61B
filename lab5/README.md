# Lab5 Experience

1. In the Plip.chooseAction() method, we do not need to build a for-loop for each rule;
2. Instead, each rule of the Plip Action should be a branch of else-if structure;
3. The Clorus class is similar to the Plip class, but the most important hint is that the energy of Clorus
  could be less than zero. Thus the Clorus creature will not fill in the whole field.
